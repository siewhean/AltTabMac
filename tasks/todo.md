# Todo

## 2026-08-01 — Fail-closed commerce worker stabilization

- [x] Reproduce the production `/api/internal/license-outbox` database error from Vercel runtime evidence.
- [x] Add one canonical launch-switch helper for `CMDTAB_REQUIRE_COMMERCE_READY=1`.
- [x] Keep worker authentication mandatory and return `commerce_disabled` before commerce database access while launch is disabled.
- [x] Gate the Lemon Squeezy webhook before configuration, body processing, fulfillment, refund handling, or lifecycle database access; return a retryable 503 while commerce is disabled.
- [x] Add unit coverage for exact launch-switch values.
- [x] Add source contracts proving both disabled branches contain their returns before any commerce sink.
- [x] Run the Vercel website, security, commerce, SEO/GEO, dependency, TypeScript, and Next.js production gates.
- [x] Trigger and rerun GitHub Security, SEO/GEO, and Release Readiness workflows; record that the account rejected them before any runner step.
- [x] Preserve the existing frontend UI, copy, media, layout, native Swift, and packaging source.

### Review

- The exact final head and preview deployment are recorded in PR #40 after all review corrections.
- Vercel preview gates require 45 unit tests and 6 commerce-readiness tests with no failures, zero dependency vulnerabilities, API-security and SEO/GEO verification, TypeScript, and the production Next.js build.
- GitHub Actions were rerun but every job returned `steps: null` and no log because hosted Actions capacity was unavailable. This is recorded as an infrastructure waiver, not as a CI pass.
- Production runtime revalidation remains required after the merge deployment.
