## 2026-03-27 — CmdTab Product Differentiation Pass

- [x] Add deterministic command-palette search scoring and persistent query memory.
- [x] Add window visibility and display-placement preferences for space/display targeting.
- [x] Add switcher quick actions plus exclusion/decluttering rules.
- [x] Improve permission diagnostics and radial-mode selection clarity.
- [x] Update website copy for the founder-price / direct-sale launch path.
- [x] Verify the Swift package and website builds, then update `README.md` and record review notes here.

## Product Differentiation Review

- Added `PaletteSearch`, `SearchMemoryStore`, and new unit coverage so command-palette filtering now ranks acronym matches, remembers prior selections, and keeps deterministic result ordering.
- Replaced the old background-window toggle with `WindowVisibilityScope` plus `SwitcherDisplayPreference`, and mirrored the switcher to every display when `All Displays` is selected.
- Added quick actions (`⌘H`, `⌘M`, `⌘W`, `⌘Q`), exclusion text rules, and a stronger permissions status surface in Settings.
- Tightened the radial UI so the selected item is called out in the center with a stronger ring/indicator treatment.
- Updated the marketing copy to mention the planned 14-day trial, founder pricing, and one-time-license positioning without adding checkout.
- `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/CmdTab-test` passed with 62 tests.
- `npm run typecheck` passed in `website/`.
- `npx next build --webpack` passed in `website/`.

## 2026-03-27 — CmdTab Marketing Website

- [x] Scaffold a standalone `website/` Next.js App Router project inside the repo.
- [x] Build the homepage, privacy page, metadata routes, and screenshot-led marketing sections.
- [x] Add typed content/config modules plus shared UI primitives for the site.
- [x] Implement the hardened `/api/waitlist` endpoint with validation, rate limiting, and Resend integration.
- [x] Create the first batch of website visuals and wire them into the landing page.
- [x] Install dependencies and verify the site builds cleanly.
- [x] Update `README.md` with the new website task context and record review notes here.

## Website Review

- `npm install` completed successfully in `website/`.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npx next build --webpack` passed and generated the homepage, privacy page, metadata routes, and dynamic waitlist endpoint.
- Plain `next build` hit a Turbopack sandbox panic while processing PostCSS (`binding to a port`); the Webpack-backed production build succeeded, so the issue appears environment-specific rather than app-code-specific.
- Runtime waitlist delivery still needs real values for `RESEND_API_KEY`, `WAITLIST_FROM_EMAIL`, and `WAITLIST_TO_EMAIL` before the API can send notifications.

## 2026-03-27 — Reliable 100ms `⌘Tab` Hold-to-Show

- [x] Refactor `HotkeyManager` pending state into an explicit trigger helper/state model.
- [x] Lock hidden `⌘Tab` reveal timing to the first keydown while keeping `⌥Tab` on its legacy repeated-keydown path.
- [x] Clear pending hotkey trigger state for `Esc`, `Return`, and click commits so modifier release cannot double-activate.
- [x] Add focused trigger-state tests and verify the package test suite passes.
- [x] Update `README.md` and record review notes for the completed fix.

## Review

- `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/CmdTab-test` passed with 38 tests.
- Follow-up fix anchored hidden `⌘Tab` timing to the event tap's original `CGEvent` timestamp instead of a later main-queue uptime sample.
- Manual hotkey QA on a live macOS desktop is still pending.
