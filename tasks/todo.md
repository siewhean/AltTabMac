# Todo

## 2026-08-01 — Fail-closed commerce worker stabilization

- [x] Reproduce the production `/api/internal/license-outbox` database error from Vercel runtime evidence.
- [x] Add one canonical launch-switch helper for `CMDTAB_REQUIRE_COMMERCE_READY=1`.
- [x] Keep worker authentication mandatory and return `commerce_disabled` before commerce database access while launch is disabled.
- [x] Add unit coverage for exact launch-switch values.
- [x] Add a source contract proving the disabled branch contains the return before `processLicenseOutbox(25)`.
- [x] Run the Vercel website, security, commerce, SEO/GEO, dependency, TypeScript, and Next.js production gates.
- [x] Trigger and rerun GitHub Security, SEO/GEO, and Release Readiness workflows; record that the account rejected them before any runner step.
- [x] Preserve the existing frontend UI, copy, media, layout, native Swift, and packaging source.

### Review

- Exact preview head: `9153040097d0491040a23b4e6a2d3c9f13fa1a21`.
- Vercel preview: READY; 45 unit tests and 6 commerce-readiness tests passed with no failures; dependency audit reported zero vulnerabilities; TypeScript and the production Next.js build passed.
- GitHub Actions were rerun but every job returned `steps: null` and no log because hosted Actions capacity was unavailable. This is recorded as an infrastructure waiver, not as a CI pass.
- Production runtime revalidation remains required after the merge deployment.

- [x] 2. Update `website/src/app/buy/page.tsx` to embed `TrialWaitlistForm` section directly on `/buy`
- [x] 3. Audit all site navigation links and CTAs to ensure zero 404/broken links
